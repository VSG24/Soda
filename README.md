# Soda
A simple PHP MVC framework

*Includes just the basics and a few helper classes and functions*



You can understand how it works by simply configuring your webserver to run Soda and start browsing the included `HomeController`. It's also helpful to take a look at `bootstrap.php` and overal project structure (folder structure).
